    <h2>Fried Eggs Recipe</h2>
    <p>Good morning! It genuinely does not get much better than some eggs in the morning.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process and Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium (10-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high until it ripples like the ocean. (This can take 2 to 2Â½ minutes).</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the pan. To minimize splatters and spreading, open the shell near the oil (not from high up), and slowly let the egg pour out of the shell. Leave the eggs untouched until the edges are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently tilt the pan towards you, spoon up some of the oil, and baste just the whites and edges of the yolk until the whites are set, about 1 minute. (Avoid the yolk so that it stays runny). Turn off the heat, season with salt and pepper, then transfer the eggs to plates using a spoon or slotted spatula.</li>
    </ol>
