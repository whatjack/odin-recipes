    <h2>Wedding Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <p>Good evening! I love to make these cookies during the holidays,
        in fact, I've actually never eaten one at a wedding. They are
        so good and so light and enjoyable.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup pecan halves</li>
        <li>2½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process and Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pecans, 1 cup of the sugar and salt in food processor and blend until nuts are ground fine. Cut the butter into tablespoon-size pieces and add it to nut mixture with processor running. Process until smooth. Add vanilla extract. Add flour and continue blending, using pulse mechanism of processor.</li>
        <li>Scrape dough into a bowl. Cover tightly and refrigerate one hour. 3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Scoop dough with tablespoon and form 1-inch balls by rolling dough between palms (lightly flour hands, if necessary). Place balls 1½ inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes or until the cookies barely begin to brown. Cool for 2 minutes. Use small spatula to lift cookies from sheets. Roll the cookies in the remaining sugar.</li>
    </ol>
